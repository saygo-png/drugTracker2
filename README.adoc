== About
The goal of this program is to keep track of pills. +
I created this for myself, as I have to take medicine daily
but have a rotating sleep schedule.

What does it actually do?

* Records the date and name of each pill taken
* Lists past entries using relative and absolute time
* Periodically reminds you about pills you forgot to take using Freedesktop notifications
* Stores data in a simple CSV file, following the XDG Base Directory Specification

[WARNING]
====
This program is new and experimental. I'm also inexperienced as a developer.
A bug in the time handling could exist, leading to wrong
dates being displayed or reminders fired at the wrong time.
The information provided by this program should not be trusted by default. Assume it's incorrect and always verify it.
Some medications require precise timing to be safe. Relying fully on this program is dangerous. Use common sense.
====

== Usage
Create drug definitions using `drug create`.
These define how often a drug should be taken and its name.
After you take your medication, use `drug take`
to choose the appropriate definition.
Use `drug list` or `drug list -d` to show
past entries with relative time.
Use `drug remind` to see what pills you might need to take.

== Installing
drugTracker2 is provided as a Home Manager module and a standalone binary.
The module adds a systemd service which runs a reminder periodically.
The standalone binary is just that â€” setting up the reminding mechanism is left
to the user. You can set up a systemd service, cron entry, or whatever else.
Simply periodically call `drug remind`. You can also use the exit code to do something
depending on the output.
If not using the Nix package, you need `fzf` and `notify-send` (from `libnotify`) in your $PATH
as they are runtime dependencies.

=== Home Manager module (flakes)
Add an input like this to flake.nix:
```nix
drugtracker2 = {
  url = "github:saygo-png/drugTracker2";
};
```
Import the module inside Home Manager like so:
```nix
home-manager.users.username = { ... }:
  {
    imports = [
      inputs.drugtracker2.homeManagerModules.default
    ];
    programs.drugtracker2 = {
      enable = true;
      remindFrequency = "hourly"; # Uses the "onCalendar" format from systemd timers
    };
  };
```

=== NixOS standalone binary (flakes)
Add an input like this to flake.nix:
```nix
drugtracker2 = {
  url = "github:saygo-png/drugTracker2";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```
Add this to your configuration.nix:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  inputs.drugtracker2.packages.${pkgs.system}.drug
];
```

== Building
The primary way of building the project is through `nix build`.
`cabal build` can be used, but results may vary
as the dependencies are not locked.

== Contributing
`nix fmt` to format all files.
`nix shell` to jump into a shell with `drug` available.
The non-flake `nix-shell` is also supported.

== Todo
* [ ] Add JSON output to `drug remind`
** [ ] Add JSON configuration
