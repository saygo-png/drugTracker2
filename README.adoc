= drugTracker2

== About

The goal of the program is to keep track of pills. +
I made this for myself, as I have to take medicine everyday,
but have a rotating sleep cycle.

What does it actually do?

- Writes down the date and name of a pill that is taken
- Lists past entries using relative and absolute time
- Stores data in a simple csv file, using the XDG Base Directory Specification

== Building

The main way of building the project is through `nix build`.

`cabal build` can be used, but mileage in building
may vary as the dependencies there are not locked.

== Contributing

`nix fmt` to format all files.

`nix shell` to jump into a shell with `drug` available.
The non flake `nix-shell` is also supported
